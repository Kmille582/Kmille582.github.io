        <p>My name is Kathryn Miller, I’m a senior Design student at Western Washington University. I’ve been at Western since 2019 and I’ve loved every second of it. I live with my wonderful fiancé named Mason, he’s been putting up with me for almost 7 years now! My hobbies include drawing, being a film snob, and horseback riding. I’ve been working with horses for about 15 years, and I hope to own my own horses someday! I currently have 1 pet, a young cat named Milk. She’s a little terror and our downstairs neighbors are not fans of her 2 AM zoomies. I am very close with my family who live in Sammamish, WA – my mom, my dad, and my younger brother. More talents of mine include killing houseplants, acquiring excessive knowledge on really niche topics, and scouring Zillow for interesting real estate.</p>
